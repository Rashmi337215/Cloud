1. Go to home directory
cd ~
Why: Start from a known location.

2️. Create the shell script
nano smvitm.sh
Why: To write all required commands inside a shell script file as asked in the question.

3️. Write this inside smvitm.sh
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p smvitm
cd smvitm
mkdir cs ec ai ad me ce
mkdir 6a 6b 6c
cd 6a
mkdir bcs601 bcs602
cd bcs601
mkdir 6a 6b 6c
touch 6a/cs_bcs601_6a_feedback.txt
touch 6b/cs_bcs601_6b_feedback.txt
touch 6c/cs_bcs601_6c_feedback.txt
cd ..
cd bcs602
mkdir 6a 6b 6c
touch 6a/cs_bcs602_6a_feedback.txt
touch 6b/cs_bcs602_6b_feedback.txt
touch 6c/cs_bcs602_6c_feedback.txt
cd ~
Why inside file:
Because the question explicitly asks for a shell script, and scripts allow automation, reusability, and proper execution order.

4️. Save and exit
CTRL + O
ENTER
CTRL + X


Why: Save the script.
5️. Give execute permission
chmod +x smvitm.sh
Why: Allows Linux to run the file as a program.

6️. Run the script
./smvitm.sh
Why: Executes all commands automatically.

7️. Install tree (as YOU did)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y tree
Why: tree is not installed by default in Cloud Shell.

8️. Verify using tree
tree smvitm
Why: Shows directory structure clearly for verification and examiner.
